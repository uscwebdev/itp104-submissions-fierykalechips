                What is a cat?
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Why, it is a wonderful little creature.
                With four slinky limbs, a round observant face,
                and a physics defying body, a cat seems to be a perfect
                companion for your home. They offer amazing rates of
                mood improvement, simply just by existing in your home
                or environment!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
                Cats are often thought of as the opposite of dogs, who are
                far more energetic and loyal, whereas a cat is independent and
                nonchalant. Nevertheless, a cat is a wonderful addition to anyone's
                life, yours included!
            </p>

            <h2>
                Skills
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Cats have a wide range of skills and hobbies. They often act
                on their own wants and needs, such as sitting (pictured on the right)
                or sleeping for 18 hours a day. In the rare occasion that a cat is
                awake and active, they enjoy leisure activities such as looking out
                the window wistfully and meowing bloody murder for the next meal. Though
                the listed skills seem simple, cats have ulterior motives behind all of
                their actions, such as destroy, manipulate, or lounge.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
                Cats are very intelligent animals and definitely have their own feelings
                independent of their humans. Cats can often feel a sense of recklessness,
                in which they seemingly do things to purposely be a nuissance. This can be
                mild, such as knocking things off the counter, or more severe, like scratching
                up the furniture.

            <h2>
                Interacting with Cats
            </h2>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Cats seem pretty independent based on the description thus far, but that does
                not mean that we as humans should avoid contact with them. There are many
                ways to entertain felines and interact with them smoothly. Many cats enjoy the
                occasional head and chin rub, and will close their eyes blissfully when enjoying
                the service. Outside of the tame interactions, cats enjoy more aggressive and
                energetic interactions too.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
                Most cats have an innate instinct to hunt, even though they live
                peacefully in a home where their every meal is provided for. To supplement this
                enrichment, one can use "cat toys" to simulate a small critter for your cat to
                chase around and catch. Another instinct leftover from their ancestral wild life
                would be their intense love for butt pats. They love being absolutely bonked on
                their butts, it is like a nice massage for them!
