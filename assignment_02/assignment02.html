            What is a cat?
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Why, it is a wonderful little creature.
            With four slinky limbs, a round observant face,
            and a physics defying body, a cat seems to be a perfect
            companion for your home. They offer amazing rates of
            mood improvement, simply just by existing in your home
            or environment!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
            Cats are often thought of as the opposite of dogs, who are
            far more energetic and loyal, whereas a cat is independent and
            nonchalant. Nevertheless, a cat is a wonderful addition to anyone's
            life, yours included!

        <h2>
            Skills
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Cats have a wide range of skills and hobbies. They often act
            on their own wants and needs, such as sitting (pictured on the right)
            or sleeping for 18 hours a day. In the rare occasion that a cat is
            awake and active, they enjoy leisure activities such as looking out
            the window wistfully and meowing bloody murder for the next meal. Though
            the listed skills seem simple, cats have ulterior motives behind all of
            their actions, such as destroy, manipulate, or lounge.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
            Cats are very intelligent animals and definitely have their own feelings
            independent of their humans. Cats can often feel a sense of recklessness,
            in which they seemingly do things to purposely be a nuissance. This can be 
            mild, such as knocking things off the counter, or more severe, like scratching
            up the furniture.

        <h2>
            Interacting with Cats
        </h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Cats seem pretty independent based on the description thus far, but that does
            not mean that we as humans should avoid contact with them. There are many
            ways to entertain felines and interact with them smoothly. Many cats enjoy the
            occasional head and chin rub, and will close their eyes blissfully when enjoying
            the service. Outside of the tame interactions, cats enjoy more aggressive and 
            energetic interactions too.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
            Most cats have an innate instinct to hunt, even though they live
            peacefully in a home where their every meal is provided for. To supplement this
            enrichment, one can use "cat toys" to simulate a small critter for your cat to
            chase around and catch. Another instinct leftover from their ancestral wild life
            would be their intense love for butt pats. They love being absolutely bonked on 
            their butts, it is like a nice massage for them!
